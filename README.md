# Task

Given SMS we have to classify it into two categories whether it is Spam or Ham (Normal)

# Approach

- Used NLTK,Regex to preprocess text
- Used Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert the words into vectors
- Algorithms Used
  - Linear SVM
  - RBF SVM
  - Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Using Count Vectorizer/TF-IDF Vectorizer does not impact in significant difference of F1-Score so choosing simpler one i.e. Count Vectorizer
- The best F1-Score achieved using Multinomial Naive Bayes i.e. 0.92
